Hi! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Education Data Science at Stanford University. My research uses a policy lens to promote equitable access to advanced STEM coursework for secondary students. I apply causal inference methods developed in economics, political science, and machine learning to problems in education. Recently, I showed that a new Advanced Placement computer science course, designed to attract students from underrepresented groups, successfully caused huge jumps in participation among Black, Hispanic, and female students. Currently, through a research-practice partnership with a local high school district, I'm investigating whether a science class detracking initiative was able to positively influence academic and behavioral outcomes. My work is supported by the Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship, Stanford Graduate Fellowship in Science & Engineering, George P. Shultz Dissertation Support Fund at SIEPR, and Emerging Education Policy Scholars program.

Prior to Stanford, I taught math and AI at an international school in Italy and then led the curriculum and instruction team at a startup offering AI courses to secondary students. I continue to work on curriculum development and teacher preparation in AI. I received a B.S. in Computer Science and Math, M.Eng. in Computer Science, and teaching license in secondary math from MIT.
